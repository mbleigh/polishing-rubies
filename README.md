## Contributing

I already have some idea of the flow and structure of the posts, however I would love to see help on:

1. Any mistakes that I make in any of the articles. If you would like to correct something, please do and send me a pull request!
2. Submit an issue if you have a specific area that you would like to request to be covered. I want this to be a thorough guide.
